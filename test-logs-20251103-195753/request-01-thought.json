      "reasoning": "Listing all facilities involves retrieving information about each facility available in the system. This task requires querying the database to fetch facility details, which can be achieved using the `list_facilities` tool. The tool can be tailored with optional filters such as `shortCode` or `location` to refine the search results if needed.",
      "approaches": [
        "Use the `list_facilities` tool without any additional filters to retrieve a comprehensive list of all facilities.",
        "Utilize the `list_facilities` tool with specific filters like `shortCode` or `location` to narrow down the results based on particular criteria.",
        "Implement a custom script that iterates through the facilities and retrieves detailed information individually if needed."
      ],
      "constraints": [
        "The tool should be able to handle a potentially large dataset of facilities efficiently.",
        "The user query specifies showing all facilities, so the response should include all available facilities without omissions."

      "assumptions": [
        "The user request is for a complete list of all facilities without any specific criteria for filtering.",
        "The system has the capability to retrieve and display information about all facilities in a readable format."

      "uncertainties": [
        "The volume of facilities in the database is unknown, so the query response time may vary depending on the number of facilities."

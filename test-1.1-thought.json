This query is essential for various tasks like facility selection, monitoring, and analysis. To address this query effectively, we need to consider the available tools for facility listing and any specific requirements or constraints related to facility data retrieval.","approaches":["Utilize the **list_facilities** tool: This tool allows us to retrieve a list of all facilities with optional filters like short code and location. By using this tool, we can efficiently fetch all facility data without the need for individual queries.","Implement a workflow template: The **compare-facilities-performance** workflow template can also be considered as it provides a structured approach to comparing performance metrics across multiple facilities. Although the primary goal is to list facilities, this template might offer additional insights that could be valuable."],"constraints":["Data Accuracy: The listing should ensure that all facilities are correctly retrieved without missing any entries.","Performance: The operation should be optimized to handle a large number of facilities efficiently.","Data Security: Ensure that only authorized users can access facility information."],"assumptions":["The user query requires a simple listing of all facilities without any specific filtering criteria.","The focus is on retrieving basic facility information without detailed analysis."],"uncertainties":["The volume of facilities in the system and the potential impact on query performance.","The need for additional information beyond basic facility details."],"confidence":0.49999999999999994}],"primaryApproach":"Utilize the **list_facilities** tool: This tool allows us to retrieve a list of all facilities with optional filters like short code and location.
